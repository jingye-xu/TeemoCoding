# 1779. Find Nearest Point That Has the Same X or Y Coordinate

## Problem

You are given two integers, `x` and `y`, which represent your current location on a Cartesian grid: `(x, y)`. You are also given an array `points` where each `points[i] = [ai, bi]` represents that a point exists at `(ai, bi)`. A point is **valid** if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location.

Return the index **(0-indexed)** of the **valid** point with the smallest **Manhattan distance** from your current location. If there are multiple, return the valid point with the **smallest** index. If there are no valid points, return `-1`.

The **Manhattan distance** between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: x = 3, y = 4, points = [[1,2],[3,1],[2,4],[2,3],[4,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Of all the points, only [3,1], [2,4] and [4,4] are valid. Of the valid points, [2,4] and [4,4] have the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location, with a distance of 1. [2,4] has the smallest index, so return 2.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: x = 3, y = 4, points = [[3,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: The answer is allowed to be on the same location as your current location.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: x = 3, y = 4, points = [[2,3]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no valid points.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= points.length <= 10^4
* points[i].length == 2
* 1 <= x, y, ai, bi <= 10^4

    def nearestValidPoint(self, x: int, y: int, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        # initial values
        min_idx = -1
        # 10^4 * 2
        min_dis = 20000
        
        for i in range(len(points)):
            
            # validation check
            if points[i][0] == x or points[i][1] == y:
                
                # get the distance
                current_dis = abs(points[i][0] - x) + abs(points[i][1] - y)
                
                # check and update
                if current_dis < min_dis:
                    # directly update
                    min_dis = current_dis
                    min_idx = i
                
                elif current_dis == min_dis:
                    # only the new valid's index smaller
                    # we update idx
                    if sum(points[i]) < sum(points[min_idx]):
                        min_idx = i
        
        return min_idx
