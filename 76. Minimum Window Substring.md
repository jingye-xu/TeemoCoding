# 76. Minimum Window Substring

## Problem

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

## Constraints

* m == s.length
* n == t.length
* 1 <= m, n <= 10^5
* s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        
        c_t = collections.Counter(t)
        
        if not t or not s:
            return ""

        # Number of unique characters in t, which need to be present in the desired window.
        required = len(c_t)

        # left and right pointer
        l, r = 0, 0

        # formed is used to keep track of how many unique characters in t are present in the current window in its desired frequency.
        # e.g. if t is "AABC" then the window must have two A's, one B and one C. Thus formed would be = 3 when all these conditions are met.
        formed = 0

        # Dictionary which keeps a count of all the unique characters in the current window.
        window_counts = {}

        # ans tuple of the form (window length, left, right)
        ans = float("inf"), None, None

        while r < len(s):

            # Add one character from the right to the window
            character = s[r]
            window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1

            # If the frequency of the current character added equals to the desired count in t then increment the formed count by 1.
            if character in c_t and window_counts[character] == c_t[character]:
                formed += 1

            # Try and contract the window till the point where it ceases to be 'desirable'.
            while l <= r and formed == required:
                character = s[l]

                # Save the smallest window until now.
                if r - l + 1 < ans[0]:
                    ans = (r - l + 1, l, r)

                # The character at the position pointed by the `left` pointer is no longer a part of the window.
                window_counts[character] -= 1
                if character in c_t and window_counts[character] < c_t[character]:
                    formed -= 1

                # Move the left pointer ahead, this would help to look for a new window.
                l += 1    

            # Keep expanding the window once we are done contracting.
            r += 1    

        return "" if ans[0] == float("inf") else s[ans[1] : ans[2] + 1]
