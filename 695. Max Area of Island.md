# 695. Max Area of Island

## Problem

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum **area** of an island in `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

* m == grid.length
* n == grid[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 50
* grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        max_area = 0
        
        row, col = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        def dfs(i: int, j: int) -> int:
            if 0 <= i < row and 0 <= j < col and grid[i][j] == 1:
                
                # mark visited
                grid[i][j] = 2
                return 1 + dfs(i-1,j) + dfs(i+1,j) + dfs(i,j-1) + dfs(i,j+1)
            else:
                return 0
        
        for i in range(row):
            for j in range(col):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    max_area = max(max_area, dfs(i, j))
        
        return max_area
```
