# 875. Koko Eating Bananas

## Problem

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

### Example 2

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```

### Example 3

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= piles.length <= 10^4
* piles.length <= h <= 10^9
* 1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:

        # two pointers for binary search
        # 0 will lead errors, so start to 1
        start = 1
        end = max(piles)

        # binary search
        while start < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            if self.hoursTakenToEat(piles, mid) <= h:
                end = mid
            else:
                start = mid + 1

        # if start still cannot fulfill the requirement
        if self.hoursTakenToEat(piles, start) > h:
            return start + 1
        else:
            return start

    def hoursTakenToEat(self, piles: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        """
        calculate how long it takes to each all bananas
        """
        res = 0

        for bananas in piles:
            # need ceil function
            res += math.ceil(bananas / k)
        
        return res
```
