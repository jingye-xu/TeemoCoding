# 278. First Bad Version

## Problem

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        # two pointers
        # l points to the last good version, r points to the first bad version
        
        # base case
        if isBadVersion(1):
            return 1
        
        i = 1
        j = n
        
        # the condition is special
        # since we need update i/j depending on the if mid is bad or not
        # when j-i == 1, we should terminate
        while i < j - 1:
            mid = (i+j) // 2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                j = mid
            else:
                i = mid
        
        return j
```
