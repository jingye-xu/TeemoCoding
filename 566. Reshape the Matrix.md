# 566. Reshape the Matrix

## Problem

In MATLAB, there is a handy function called `reshape` which can reshape an `m x n` matrix into a new one with a different size `r x c` keeping its original data.

You are given an `m x n` matrix `mat` and two integers `r` and `c` representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted reshaped matrix.

The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the `reshape` operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/reshape1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 1, c = 4
Output: [[1,2,3,4]]
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/reshape2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 2, c = 4
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
```

## Constraints

* m == mat.length
* n == mat[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 100
* -1000 <= mat[i][j] <= 1000
* 1 <= r, c <= 300

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def matrixReshape(self, mat: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        # check legal 
        if r*c != len(mat)*len(mat[0]):
            return mat
        
        # special case
        if r == len(mat) and c == len(mat[0]):
            return mat
        
        res = []
        
        # initial values
        row = []
        count_c = 0
        
        for i in range(len(mat)):
            for j in range(len(mat[0])):
                
                # append to current row
                row.append(mat[i][j])
                # count how many elements that have already in current row
                count_c += 1
                # if reachs to c
                if count_c == c:
                    # append to res
                    res.append(row)
                    # reset row
                    row = []
                    # reset count_c
                    count_c = 0
        
        return res
```
