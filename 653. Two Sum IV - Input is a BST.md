# 653. Two Sum IV - Input is a BST

## Problem

Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree and a target number `k`, return `true` if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to the given target.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/sum_tree_1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/sum_tree_2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
* -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
* root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
* -10^5 <= k <= 10^5

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def findTarget(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> bool:
        
        # store seen
        seen = set()
        
        # add root in queue first
        queue = [root]
        
        while queue:
            current = queue.pop(0)
            
            # if the difference in seen, we find the pair
            if k-current.val in seen:
                return True
            
            # add to seen
            seen.add(current.val)
            
            # add new nodes
            if current.left:
                queue.append(current.left)
            if current.right:
                queue.append(current.right)
                
        
        return False
```
