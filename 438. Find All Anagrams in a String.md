# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

## Problem

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10^4
* s and p consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:

        # base case
        if len(p) > len(s):
            return []
        
        n = len(p)

        count = defaultdict(int)

        for i in range(n):
            count[p[i]] += 1
            count[s[i]] -= 1

        res = []
        if all(value == 0 for value in count.values()):
            res.append(0)
        
        # two pointers for sliding window
        i = 1
        j = i+n-1

        while j < len(s):
            count[s[i-1]] += 1
            count[s[j]] -= 1

            if all(value == 0 for value in count.values()):
                res.append(i)
            
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
        return res
```
