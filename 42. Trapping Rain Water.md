# 42. Trapping Rain Water

## Problem

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

## Constraints

* n == height.length
* 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
* 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # get length
        n = len(height)
        
        # base case
        if n < 2:
            return 0
        
        # use two lists to store shadows to left and right
        # the shadows can store info regarding to left max and right max
        left_max = [0] * n
        right_max = [0] * n
        
        left_max[0] = height[0]
        right_max[n-1] = height[n-1]
        
        # dynamic programing
        for i in range(1, n):
            # basic idea here is:
            # for left max, we assume there is a sun shine from the left, we calculate the shadow height
            left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], height[i])
            # for right max, we assume there is a sun shine from the right, we calculate the shadow height
            right_max[n-1-i] = max(right_max[n-1-i+1], height[n-1-i])
        
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            # the min between left_max and right_max determines the actual shadow height at that index
            # then minus the height
            # we got the water volumn at that index
            res += min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i]
            
        return res
```
