# 1704. Determine if String Halves Are Alike

## Problem

You are given a string s of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let a be the first half and b be the second half.

Two strings are alike if they have the same number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). Notice that s contains uppercase and lowercase letters.

Return true if a and b are alike. Otherwise, return false.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "book"
Output: true
Explanation: a = "bo" and b = "ok". a has 1 vowel and b has 1 vowel. Therefore, they are alike.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "textbook"
Output: false
Explanation: a = "text" and b = "book". a has 1 vowel whereas b has 2. Therefore, they are not alike.
Notice that the vowel o is counted twice.
```

## Constraints

* 2 <= s.length <= 1000
* s.length is even.
* s consists of uppercase and lowercase letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def halvesAreAlike(self, s: str) -> bool:
        
        res = 0
        
        check_list = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
        
        # go through the string
        for i,k in enumerate(s):
            # first half
            if i < len(s) / 2 and k in check_list:
                res += 1
            # second half
            elif i >= len(s) / 2 and k in check_list:
                res -= 1
        
        return res == 0
```
