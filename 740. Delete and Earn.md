# 740. Delete and Earn

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

  * Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and **every** element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.
Return the **maximum number of points** you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # default is 0
        count = defaultdict(int)
        
        # default bot and top boundary
        bot = float("inf")
        top = -float("inf")
        
        # count
        for i in nums:
            count[i] += 1
            bot = min(bot, i)
            top = max(top, i)
        
        # base case
        # list only contains one distinct number
        if bot == top:
            return sum(nums)
        # list only contains two distinct numbers
        if top - bot == 1:
            return max(count[bot]*bot, count[top]*top)
        
        # initial values
        res = [count[bot]*bot, max(count[bot]*bot, count[bot+1]*(bot+1))]
        
        for i in range(bot+2, top+1):
            res.append(max(res[-1], res[-2]+count[i]*i))
        
        return res[-1]
```
