# 1675. Minimize Deviation in Array

## Problem

You are given an array nums of n positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:

* If the element is even, divide it by 2.

  * For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be [1,2,3,2].

* If the element is odd, multiply it by 2.
  * For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be [2,2,3,4].

The deviation of the array is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can transform the array to [1,2,3,2], then to [2,2,3,2], then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [4,1,5,20,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can transform the array after two operations to [4,2,5,5,3], then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: nums = [2,10,8]
Output: 3
```

## Constraints

* n == nums.length
* 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def minimumDeviation(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        evens = []

        min_val = float('inf')
        
        # make all number to even and manage a even queue, since heapq is a min queue, we want a max queue,
        # when add new num, we times -1
        for num in nums:
            # if the num is even, push the -num to the queue
            if num % 2 == 0:
                heapq.heappush(evens, -num)
                # update the minimal value
                min_val = min(num, min_val)
            # if the num is odd, times 2 and push the -num*2 to the queue
            else:
                heapq.heappush(evens, -num * 2)
                # update the minimal value
                min_val = min(num * 2, min_val)
        
        res = float('inf')
        print(evens)
        
        # stops when the max_val is odd, because the odd can only be times by 2, which will increase the deviation
        # if we skip that max_val, the deviation cannot be minimized since the max_val is always the odd number
        
        while evens[0] % 2 == 0:
            # pop the minimal value, transfer it to positive number
            max_val = -heapq.heappop(evens)
            print(max_val)
            # update deviation
            res = min(res, max_val - min_val)

            # update new num to be inserted
            new_num = max_val // 2
            # push the new num into the queue, do not forget to times -1
            heapq.heappush(evens, -new_num)

            # update min_val
            min_val = min(new_num, min_val)

        res = min(-evens[0] - min_val, res)
        
        return res
```
