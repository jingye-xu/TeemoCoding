# 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary

## Problem

In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= words.length <= 100
* 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
* order.length == 26
* All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
        
        # base case
        if len(words) == 1:
            return True
        
        for i in range(len(words) - 1):
            # as long as find one invalid, return False
            if not self.isWordSorted(words[i], words[i+1], order):
                return False
        
        return True
        
    def isWordSorted(self, word1: str, word2: str, order: str) -> bool:
        
        # initial values
        i = 0
        
        # go through the first n elements
        while i < min(len(word1), len(word2)):
            if order.index(word1[i]) > order.index(word2[i]):
                return False
            elif order.index(word1[i]) < order.index(word2[i]):
                return True
            else:
                i += 1
        
        # if program goes there, means the first i elements are the same
        # then check if word2 is longer than word1
        if len(word1) > len(word2):
            return False
        else:
            return True
```
