# 1356. Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits

## Problem

You are given an integer array `arr`. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of `1`'s in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of `1`'s you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return the array after sorting it.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
Explantion: [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.
[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
[3,5,6] have 2 bits.
[7] has 3 bits.
The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: arr = [1024,512,256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]
Output: [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024]
Explantion: All integers have 1 bit in the binary representation, you should just sort them in ascending order.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= arr.length <= 500
* 0 <= arr[i] <= 10^4

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def sortByBits(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        # base case
        if len(arr) == 1:
            return arr
        
        # a dict to store numbers by different Ones
        # key is number of Ones
        seen = defaultdict(list)
        
        # first round to calculate the Ones
        for i in arr:
            count = self.countOnes(i)
            seen[count].append(i)
        
        res = []
        
        # loop start from lowest keys
        for i in sorted(seen.keys()):
            # append all elements have the same number of ones
            res.extend(sorted(seen[i]))
        
        return res
    
    # count how many 1s in the binary representation
    def countOnes(self, number: int) -> int:
        
        res = 0
        
        while number:
            if number & 1:
                res += 1
            number >>= 1
        
        return res
```
