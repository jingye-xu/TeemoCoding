# 344. Reverse String

## Problem

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array `in-place` with `O(1)` extra memory.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
* s[i] is a printable ascii character.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """

        # two pointers
        i = 0
        j = len(s) - 1
        
        while i < j:
            # O(1) extra memory
            tmp = s[i]
            s[i] = s[j]
            s[j] = tmp
            
            # update i and j
            i += 1
            j -= 1
```
