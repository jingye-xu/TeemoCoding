# 64. Minimum Path Sum

## Problem

Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note**: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/minpath.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12
```

## Constraints

* m == grid.length
* n == grid[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 200
* 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        # get length
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        # initial value
        res = [[0 for i in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
        
        res[0][0] = grid[0][0]
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i>0 and j>0:
                    res[i][j] = min(res[i-1][j], res[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
                elif i == 0 and j > 0:
                    res[i][j] = res[i][j-1] + grid[i][j]
                elif i > 0 and j == 0:
                    res[i][j] = res[i-1][j] + grid[i][j]
                
        return res[-1][-1]
```
