# 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

## Problem

Given `head` which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either `0` or `1`. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

The **most significant bit** is at the head of the linked list.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/05/graph-1.png)

```
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
```

### Example 2

```
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

* The Linked List is not empty.
* Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
* Each node's value is either 0 or 1.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        
        res = 0
        
        # terminate when head is None
        while head:
            res = res*2 + head.val
            head = head.next
        
        return res
```
