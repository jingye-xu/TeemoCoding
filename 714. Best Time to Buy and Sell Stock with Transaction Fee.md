# 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

## Problem

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i^th` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.  

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.  

**Note**: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 10^4
* 1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 10^4
* 0 <= fee < 5 * 10^4

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        
        # get length
        n = len(prices)
        
        # base case
        if n < 2:
            return 0
        
        # use cash stands for the maxprofit we have if we do not have a stock
        # use hold stands for the maxprofit we have if we have a stock
        cash, hold = 0, -prices[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            
            # update cash: either still do not have a stock or sell current minus fee
            # update hold: either still hold or buy in
            cash, hold = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee), max(hold, cash - prices[i])
        
        return cash
```
