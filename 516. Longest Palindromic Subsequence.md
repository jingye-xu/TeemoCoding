# 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence

## Problem

Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic **subsequence**'s length in `s`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* s consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        # get length
        n = len(s)
        
        cache = {}
        
        # helper(l, r) returns the longest palindromic's length, starts from l stops at r
        def helper(l, r):
            
            # found, return
            if (l,r) in cache: return cache[(l,r)]
            
            # left index is higher than r
            if l > r: return 0
            
            # l == r, the max
            if l == r: return 1
            
            # conditions
            if s[l] == s[r]:
                
                # store to cache
                cache[(l,r)] = helper(l + 1, r - 1) + 2
                # return
                return cache[(l, r)]
            
            # else
            cache[(l,r)] = max(helper(l, r - 1), helper(l + 1, r))
            
            # return
            return cache[(l, r)]

        return helper(0, n - 1) 
```
