# 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range

## Problem

Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` (inclusive).

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
```

## Constraints

* 0 <= low <= high <= 10^9

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        
        res = 0
        
        # terminate when low is odd and high is even
        while low % 2 == 0 or high % 2 == 1:
            # move low to the latest odd
            if low % 2 == 0:
                low += 1
            # move high to the latest even
            if high % 2 == 1:
                high -= 1
                res += 1
        
        # if high < low, we have already calculated the odd
        if high > low:
            res += (high + 1 - low) // 2
        return res
```
