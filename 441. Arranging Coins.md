# 441. Arranging Coins

## Problem

You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `i^th` row has exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase **may be** incomplete.

Given the integer `n`, return the number of **complete rows** of the staircase you will build.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/arrangecoins2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        
        # math: n >= (1+k)*k/2 
        return (int)((2 * n + 0.25)**0.5 - 0.5)

        while left < right:
            # log(n)
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            
            # check if fulfill
            if (1+mid)*mid // 2 <= n:
                res = max(res, mid)
                # update left
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                # update right
                right = mid
        
        # check the last value
        if (1+left)*left // 2 <= n:
            res = max(res, left)
