# 77. Combinations

## Problem

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return all possible combinations of `k` numbers chosen from the range `[1, n]`.

You may return the answer in **any order**.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: [[1]]
Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 20
* 1 <= k <= n

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        # base case
        if n == 1:
            # two dimensional list
            return [[1]]
        if k == n:
            # two dimensional list
            return [[i for i in range(1,n+1)]]
        
        # backtracking
        res = []
        
        def backtrack(idx, current_list):
            # when the solution reachs to len==k
            if len(current_list) == k:
                # here we use [:] in case current_list has the same address
                res.append(current_list[:])
                return
            
            # if the solution'len < k
            # keep adding elements in to current list
            for idx in range(idx, n+1):
                # add index at idx to list
                current_list.append(idx)
                # recursively call
                backtrack(idx+1, current_list)
                # instruction reaches here when find one solution
                # then, pop the last element of the current list
                # and try other solutions
                current_list.pop()
        
        # call at the very beginning
        backtrack(1, [])      
        return res
```
