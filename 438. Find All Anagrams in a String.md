# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

## Problem

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10^4
* s and p consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        
        res = []
        
        n = len(s)
        
        # m is used for sliding windows' length
        m = len(p)
        
        # special case
        if m > n:
            return []
        
        # dict_p
        dict_p = defaultdict(int)
        for i in p:
            dict_p[i] += 1

        # pass the first m -1 elements in s
        for i in range(m-1):
            if s[i] in dict_p:
                dict_p[s[i]] -= 1

        
        # sliding window
        # starts at m where the last element for current string we look at
        for i in range(m-1,n):
            # minus the one who join
            if s[i] in dict_p:
                dict_p[s[i]] -= 1
                
            # plus the one who leave
            j = i - m
            if j >= 0 and s[j] in dict_p:
                dict_p[s[j]] += 1
            # i - m + 1 = j + 1
            # j + 1 is the current string's start index
            if all(v==0 for v in dict_p.values()):
                res.append(j+1)
        
        return res
```
