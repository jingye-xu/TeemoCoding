# 1502. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence

## Problem

A sequence of numbers is called an **arithmetic progression** if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers `arr`, return `true` if the array can be rearranged to form an **arithmetic progression**. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: arr = [3,5,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: arr = [1,2,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.
```

## Constraints

* 2 <= arr.length <= 1000
* -10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def canMakeArithmeticProgression(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        # reorder
        arr = sorted(arr)
        
        n = len(arr)
        
        if n == 2:
            return True
        
        diff = arr[1] - arr[0]
        for i in range(2, n):
            if arr[i] - arr[i-1] != diff:
                return False
        
        return True
```
