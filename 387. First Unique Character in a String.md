# 387. First Unique Character in a String

## Problem

Given a string `s`, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return `-1`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
```

### Example 3

```
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
* s consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        # build hash map : character and how often it appears
        count = collections.Counter(s)
        
        # go through the s and find the index
        for i, k in enumerate(s):
            if count[k] == 1:
                return i     
        
        return -1
```
