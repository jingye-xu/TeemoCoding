# 1567. Maximum Length of Subarray With Positive Product

## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums`, find the maximum length of a subarray where the product of all its elements is positive.

A subarray of an array is a consecutive sequence of zero or more values taken out of that array.

Return the maximum length of a subarray with positive product.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,-2,-3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The array nums already has a positive product of 24.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [0,1,-2,-3,-4]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest subarray with positive product is [1,-2,-3] which has a product of 6.
Notice that we cannot include 0 in the subarray since that'll make the product 0 which is not positive.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest subarray with positive product is [-1,-2] or [-2,-3].
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
* -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution(object):
    def getMaxLen(self, nums):
        
        # initial values
        # pos: the maximun length of subarray with positive product
        pos = 0
        # pos: the maximun length of subarray with negative product
        neg = 0
        # store answer
        res = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            # if meet 0, the pos and neg should be set to zeros
            if i == 0:
                pos = 0
                neg = 0
                continue
            
            # negative
            if i < 0:
                # neg  = pos + 1
                # for pos, if neg == 0, pos = 0, if neg > 0, pos = neg +1
                pos, neg = neg + 1 if neg > 0 else 0 , pos + 1
            else:
                # pos always increment by 1
                # for neg, if neg == 0, neg = 0, if neg > 0, neg = neg + 1
                pos, neg = pos + 1, neg + 1 if neg > 0 else 0
            
            # update for each loop
            res = max(res, pos)
            
        return res
```
