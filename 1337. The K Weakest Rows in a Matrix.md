# 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix

## Problem

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat` of `1`'s (representing soldiers) and `0`'s (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned **in front** of the civilians. That is, all the 1's will appear to the **left** of all the 0's in each row.

A row `i` is **weaker** than a row `j` if one of the following is true:

  * The number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j.
  * Both rows have the same number of soldiers and i < j.

Return the indices of the `k` **weakest** rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]], 
k = 3
Output: [2,0,3]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers in each row is: 
- Row 0: 2 
- Row 1: 4 
- Row 2: 1 
- Row 3: 2 
- Row 4: 5 
The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [2,0,3,1,4].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: mat = 
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1],
 [1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]], 
k = 2
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers in each row is: 
- Row 0: 1 
- Row 1: 4 
- Row 2: 1 
- Row 3: 1 
The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [0,2,3,1].
```

## Constraints

* m == mat.length
* n == mat[i].length
* 2 <= n, m <= 100
* 1 <= k <= m
* matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def kWeakestRows(self, mat: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:
        
        res = {}
        # add results to the dict, number of soldiers is the key
        for index, row in enumerate(mat):
            tmp = self.countSoldiers(row)
            if tmp in res:
                res[tmp].append(index)
            else:
                res[tmp] = [index]
        
        sort_res = []
        
        # obtain the sorted result
        for i in sorted(res.keys()):
            sort_res.extend(res[i])
        
        # return the first k elements
        return sort_res[:k]
    
    def countSoldiers(self, row: List[int]) -> int:
        
        left = 0
        right = len(row) - 1
        
        # binary search to count soldiers
        while left < right:
            # mid
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            
            # if mid is soldier
            if row[mid] == 1:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid

        # if row[left] is soldier, left plus 1, else just return left
        return left + (row[left] or 0)
```
