# 1603. Design Parking System

## Problem

Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.

Implement the `ParkingSystem` class:

  * `ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small)` Initializes object of the `ParkingSystem` class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
  * `bool addCar(int carType)` Checks whether there is a parking space of `carType` for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. `carType` can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively. **A car can only park in a parking space of its** `carType`. If there is no space available, return `false`, else park the car in that size space and return `true`.


## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input
["ParkingSystem", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar"]
[[1, 1, 0], [1], [2], [3], [1]]
Output
[null, true, true, false, false]

Explanation
ParkingSystem parkingSystem = new ParkingSystem(1, 1, 0);
parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a big car
parkingSystem.addCar(2); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a medium car
parkingSystem.addCar(3); // return false because there is no available slot for a small car
parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return false because there is no available slot for a big car. It is already occupied.
```

## Constraints

* 0 <= big, medium, small <= 1000
* carType is 1, 2, or 3
* At most 1000 calls will be made to addCar

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class ParkingSystem:

    def __init__(self, big: int, medium: int, small: int):
        
        self.big = big
        self.medium = medium
        self.small = small

    def addCar(self, carType: int) -> bool:
        if carType == 1 and self.big > 0:
            self.big -= 1
            return True
        elif carType == 2 and self.medium > 0:
            self.medium -= 1
            return True
        elif carType == 3 and self.small > 0:
            self.small -= 1
            return True
        else:
            return False


# Your ParkingSystem object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = ParkingSystem(big, medium, small)
# param_1 = obj.addCar(carType)
```
