# 290. Word Pattern

## problem

Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
```

### Example 3

```
Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= pattern.length <= 300
* pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
* 1 <= s.length <= 3000
* s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
* s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
* All the words in s are separated by a single space.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
        # obtain word list
        words = s.split(" ")
        # dict to store word
        # set to check seen pattern
        seen_word = {}
        seen_pattern = set()

        if len(words) != len(pattern):
            return False 

        # enumerate words
        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            # seen before
            if word in seen_word:
                # check if follow
                if seen_word[word] != pattern[i]:
                    return False
            # not seen before
            else:
                # add to dict if pattern is not seen as well
                if pattern[i] not in seen_pattern:
                    seen_word[word] = pattern[i]
                    seen_pattern.add(pattern[i])
                else:
                    return False
        
        return True
```
