# 509. Fibonacci Number

## Problem

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`. That is,

```
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
```

Given `n`, calculate `F(n)`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

## Constraints

* 0 <= n <= 30

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        # boundary case
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1

        i = 2

        # initial case
        f_i = 0
        f_j = 1
        while i <= n:
            # update value, always record 2 previous values
            tmp = f_i + f_j
            f_i = f_j
            f_j = tmp
            i += 1

        return f_j
```
