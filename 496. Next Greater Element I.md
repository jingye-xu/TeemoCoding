# 496. Next Greater Element I

## Problem

The **next greater element** of some element `x` in an array is the **first greater** element that is **to the right** of `x` in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the **next greater element** of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return an array `ans` of `length nums1.length` such that `ans[i]` is the **next greater element** as described above.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
* 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^4
* All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
* All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.

```
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        # special case
        if not nums1:
            return []
        
        # if we want to solve in O(m+n)
        # build next grater for nums 2 first
        res = [-1] * len(nums1)
        dic = {}
        
        # stack is used to store elements that stores after current index
        stack = []
        
        
        # backward
        for i in range(len(nums2)-1, -1, -1):
            # terminate when finding the next greater element
            while stack and stack[-1] < nums2[i]:
                stack.pop(-1)
            
            # means stack is empty, did not find the grater element
            if not stack:
                dic[nums2[i]] = -1
                
            # found it
            else:
                dic[nums2[i]] = stack[-1]
            
            # append current element at the end of the loop
            stack.append(nums2[i])
        
        # traverse nums1
        for i in range(len(nums1)):
            res[i] = dic[nums1[i]]
        
        return res
```
