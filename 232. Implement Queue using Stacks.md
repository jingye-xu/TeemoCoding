# 232. Implement Queue using Stacks

## Problem

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using **only two stacks**. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

* `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
* `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
* `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
* `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.  

Notes:

* You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
* Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]

Explanation
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= x <= 9
* At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
* All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        
        # it requires us to use only two stacks
        # stack1 is our main stack1 that will act as the queue
        self.stack1 = []
        # stack2 is used to store elements that are poped from stack1 temporarily
        self.stack2 = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        
        # pop all elements in stack1 to stack2
        while self.stack1:
            self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())
        
        # append the new element to stack1 first
        self.stack1.append(x)
        
        # pop all elements in stack2 back to stack1
        while self.stack2:
            self.stack1.append(self.stack2.pop())

    def pop(self) -> int:
        
        # the stack1 has the right order of inserted elements,
        # we just need to pop one element
        return self.stack1.pop()

    def peek(self) -> int:
        
        # not really pop the element
        res = self.stack1.pop()
        self.stack1.append(res)
        
        return res

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        
        return not self.stack1


# Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyQueue()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.peek()
# param_4 = obj.empty()
```
