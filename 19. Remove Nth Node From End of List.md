# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

## Problem

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `n^th` node from the end of the list and return its head.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/remove_ex1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

### Example 3

```
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the list is sz.
* 1 <= sz <= 30
* 0 <= Node.val <= 100
* 1 <= n <= sz

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        # three pointers
        res = head
        ahead = head
        behind = head
        
        # ahead go n steps first
        for i in range(n):
            ahead = ahead.next
        
        # base case
        # if ahead points to None now, means n = size
        if not ahead:
            res = res.next
            return res
        
        # then ahead and behind traverse the list at the same speed
        # stops when ahead.next is None
        while ahead.next:
            ahead = ahead.next
            behind = behind.next
            
        # then skip the next node that behind points to
        behind.next = behind.next.next
        
        return res
```
