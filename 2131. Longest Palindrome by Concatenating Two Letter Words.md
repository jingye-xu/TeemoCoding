# 2131. Longest Palindrome by Concatenating Two Letter Words

## Problem

You are given an array of strings `words`. Each element of `words` consists of **two** lowercase English letters.

Create the **longest possible palindrome** by selecting some elements from `words` and concatenating them in **any order**. Each element can be selected **at most once**.

Return the `length` of the longest palindrome that you can create. If it is impossible to create any palindrome, return `0`.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: words = ["lc","cl","gg"]
Output: 6
Explanation: One longest palindrome is "lc" + "gg" + "cl" = "lcggcl", of length 6.
Note that "clgglc" is another longest palindrome that can be created.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: words = ["ab","ty","yt","lc","cl","ab"]
Output: 8
Explanation: One longest palindrome is "ty" + "lc" + "cl" + "yt" = "tylcclyt", of length 8.
Note that "lcyttycl" is another longest palindrome that can be created.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: words = ["cc","ll","xx"]
Output: 2
Explanation: One longest palindrome is "cc", of length 2.
Note that "ll" is another longest palindrome that can be created, and so is "xx".
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= words.length <= 10^5
* words[i].length == 2
* words[i] consists of lowercase English letters

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        
        seen = collections.defaultdict(int)
        
        res = 0
        
        for i in words:
            reverse_i = i[1] + i[0]
            if seen[reverse_i] > 0:
                res += 4
                seen[reverse_i] -= 1
            else:
                seen[i] += 1

        for i in seen:
            if i[0] == i[1] and seen[i] > 0:
                res += 2
                break

        return res
```
