# 392. Is Subsequence

## Problem

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a **subsequence** of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

## Constraints

* 0 <= s.length <= 100
* 0 <= t.length <= 10^4
* s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        
        # get length
        len_s = len(s)
        len_t = len(t)
        
        # base case
        if len_s == 0:
            return True
        
        # initial vlaue 
        i_s = 0
        i_t = 0
        
        # greedy, find char in t that matches s[i_s]
        while i_t < len(t) and i_s < len(s):
            
            if t[i_t] == s[i_s]:
                i_s += 1
            
            i_t += 1
        
        return True if i_s == len(s) else False
```
