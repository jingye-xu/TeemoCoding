# 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters

## Problem

You are given an array of strings `arr`. A string `s` is formed by the **concatenation** of a **subsequence** of `arr` that has **unique characters**.

Return the **maximum** possible length of `s`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: arr = ["un","iq","ue"]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the valid concatenations are:
- ""
- "un"
- "iq"
- "ue"
- "uniq" ("un" + "iq")
- "ique" ("iq" + "ue")
Maximum length is 4.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]
Output: 6
Explanation: Possible longest valid concatenations are "chaers" ("cha" + "ers") and "acters" ("act" + "ers").
```

### Example 3

```
Input: arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]
Output: 26
Explanation: The only string in arr has all 26 characters.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= arr.length <= 16
* 1 <= arr[i].length <= 26
* arr[i] contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def maxLength(self, arr: List[str]) -> int:
        
        dp = [set()]
        
        # go through each string in arr
        for a in arr:
            # has duplicated char in this string
            if len(set(a)) < len(a):
                continue
            
            a = set(a)
            
            # go thourgh previous dp
            for c in dp[:]:
                # a and c have duplicated char
                if a & c:
                    continue
                # a and c can be combined
                dp.append(a | c)
        # can use len(a) to determine the length because the set has no duplicated elements
        return max(len(a) for a in dp)
```
