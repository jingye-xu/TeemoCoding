# 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree

## Problem

You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer `val`.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals `val` and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return `null`.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/12/tree1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/12/tree2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000].
* 1 <= Node.val <= 10^7
* root is a binary search tree.
* 1 <= val <= 10^7

## solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def searchBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        
        # it is a binary tree
        # just compare current node's val with the val
        
        # when current node is not None
        while root:
            # find it, return the node
            if root.val == val:
                return root
            # current's val < val, the node may on the right
            elif root.val < val:
                root = root.right
            # the node may on the left
            else:
                root = root.left
                
        
        return None
```
