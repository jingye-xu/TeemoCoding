# 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

## Problem

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i^th` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

  * After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).  

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= prices.length <= 5000
* 0 <= prices[i] <= 1000

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # get length
        n = len(prices)
        
        # base case
        if n < 2: 
            return 0
        
        # initial values
        # buy means lose money, the value is negative
        prev_buy, prev_sell, prev_nothing = -prices[0], 0, 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            # the update order matters
            # so we use three new variables to store the values and update later
            
            # with the action buy at i, means previous action is nothing
            # the maxprofit at buy[i] = max(previous buy, previous maxprifit nothing minus current sell)
            buy  = max(prev_nothing - prices[i], prev_buy)
            
            # with the action sell at i, means previous action can be buy, and nothing
            # the maxprofit at sell[i] = max(previous sell, previous buy plus current sell)
            sell = max(prev_buy + prices[i], prev_nothing)
            
            # with the action nothing at i, the previous action could be buy, sell, and nothing
            # the maxprofit at nothing[i] = max(previous sell, )
            nothing = max(prev_sell, prev_buy, prev_nothing)
            # update at the same time
            prev_buy, prev_sell, prev_nothing = buy, sell, nothing
        
        return max(sell, nothing)
```
