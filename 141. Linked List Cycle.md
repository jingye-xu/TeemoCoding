# 141. Linked List Cycle

## Problem

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

### Example 3

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

## Constraints

* The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
* -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
* pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        
        # two pointers
        fast = head
        slow = head
        
        # the number of nodes can be 0
        # boundary case
        if not slow:
            return False
        
        # determine fast,because fast reaches the end first if no loop
        while fast.next and fast.next.next:
            # go fast and go slow
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
            
            # if meet each other
            if fast == slow:
                return True
        
        return False
```
