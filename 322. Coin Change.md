# 322. Coin Change

## Problem

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

### Example 2

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

### Example 3

```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= coins.length <= 12
* 1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1
* 0 <= amount <= 10^4

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        
        # get length
        n = len(coins)
        
        # sort
        coins.sort()
        
        # res[i] means the minimum number of coins we need to make up i
        res = [float("inf") for i in range(amount+1)]
        
        # initial value
        res[0] = 0
        
        
        for amnt in range(1, amount+1):
            for coin in coins:
                if amnt >= coin:
                    res[amnt] = min(res[amnt], res[amnt-coin] + 1)
                else:
                    break 
                    
        return res[amount] if res[amount] != math.inf else -1
```
