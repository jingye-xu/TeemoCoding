# 2348. Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays

## Problem

Given an integer array nums, return the number of subarrays filled with 0.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
There are 4 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
There are 2 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 2 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 6.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0,2,0,0]
Output: 9
Explanation:
There are 5 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
There are 3 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
There is 1 occurrence of [0,0,0] as a subarray.
There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 3 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 9.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: nums = [2,10,2019]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no subarray filled with 0. Therefore, we return 0.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
* -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def zeroFilledSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # basic idea here is count contiguous 0s, and then increment the permutation of subarray
        res = 0
        tmp = 0
        for i in nums:
            if not i:
                tmp += 1
            else:
                if tmp:
                    res += self.subarrayCount(tmp)
                tmp = 0
        if tmp:
            res += self.subarrayCount(tmp)
        return res
    def subarrayCount(self, num: int) -> int:
        return (1+num) * num // 2
```
