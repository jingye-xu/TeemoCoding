# 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree

## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-1.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-2.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
* 1 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        level = 0
        last = 0
        null = 0

        # bfs
        queue = [root]

        while queue:
            # firs time find incomplete level, mark this level as the last level
            if len(queue) != 2**level:
                last = 1
            for i in range(len(queue)):
                tmp = queue.pop(0)
                # if current level's node has left child
                if tmp.left:
                    # if already entered last level
                    if last:
                        return False
                    # if not seen null before
                    if not null:
                        queue.append(tmp.left)
                    # else seen null before
                    else:
                        return False
                # seen null
                else:
                    null = 1

                # same with left node
                if tmp.right:
                    if last:
                        return False
                    if not null:
                        queue.append(tmp.right)
                    else:
                        return False
                else:
                    null = 1
            
            level += 1
        
        return True
```
