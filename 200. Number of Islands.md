# 200. Number of Islands

## Problem

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of *islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

### Example 2

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

## Constraints

* m == grid.length
* n == grid[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 300
* grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        
        # initial value
        res = 0
        
        # traverse
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                res += self.markIsland(grid, i, j)
        
        return res
        
        
    
    def markIsland(self, grid: List[List[str]], i: int, j: int) -> int:
        
        # never accessed before
        if grid[i][j] == "1":
            
            # "2" means accessed before
            grid[i][j] = "2"
            
            # mark all 4 directions connects to "2"
            if i > 0:
                self.markIsland(grid, i-1, j)
            if i < len(grid) - 1:
                self.markIsland(grid, i+1, j)
            if j > 0:
                self.markIsland(grid, i, j-1)
            if j < len(grid[0]) - 1:
                self.markIsland(grid, i, j+1)
            
            return 1
        
        # "2" or "0" both no need to plus 1
        else:
            return 0
```
