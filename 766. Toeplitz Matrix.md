# 766. Toeplitz Matrix

## Problem

Given an `m x n` `matrix`, return `true` if the matrix is Toeplitz. Otherwise, return `false`.

A matrix is **Toeplitz** if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/ex1.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,1,2,3],[9,5,1,2]]
Output: true
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/ex2.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: false
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
```

## Constraints

* m == matrix.length
* n == matrix[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 20
* 0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 99

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def isToeplitzMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        # check one by one, starts from the second row and second column
        for i in range(1, len(matrix)):
            for j in range(1, len(matrix[0])):
                if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i-1][j-1]:
                    return False
                
        return True
```
