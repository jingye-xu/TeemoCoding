# 70. Climbing Stairs

## Problem

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 45

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        # variants of fibonacci
        # boundary cases
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2
        
        # before reach to n
        f_i = 1
        f_j = 2
        for i in range(3,n+1):
            # distince ways
            tmp = f_i + f_j

            # update
            f_i = f_j
            f_j = tmp
        
        return f_j
```
