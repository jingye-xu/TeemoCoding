# 2316. Count Unreachable Pairs of Nodes in an Undirected Graph

## Problem

You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes ai and bi.

Return the number of pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/05/tc-3.png)

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no pairs of nodes that are unreachable from each other. Therefore, we return 0.
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/05/tc-2.png)

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,2],[0,5],[2,4],[1,6],[5,4]]
Output: 14
Explanation: There are 14 pairs of nodes that are unreachable from each other:
[[0,1],[0,3],[0,6],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6],[3,4],[3,5],[3,6],[4,6],[5,6]].
Therefore, we return 14.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 10^5
* 0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 10^5
* edges[i].length == 2
* 0 <= ai, bi < n
* ai != bi
* There are no repeated edges.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        import collections

        count = collections.defaultdict(list)

        for i in edges:
            count[i[0]].append(i[1])
            count[i[1]].append(i[0])
        
        seen = [ False for i in range(n)]
        groups = []

        for i in range(n):
            if seen[i]:
                continue
            queue = deque([i])
            seen[i] = True
            tmp = 0
            while queue:
                current = queue.popleft()
                tmp += 1
                for neighbor in count[current]:
                    if not seen[neighbor]:
                        seen[neighbor] = True
                        queue.append(neighbor)
            
            groups.append(tmp)
        res = n*(n-1)//2
        for i in groups:
            res -= i*(i-1)//2
        
        return res
```
