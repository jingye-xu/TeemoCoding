# 38. Count and Say

## Problem

The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

  * countAndSay(1) = "1"
  * countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the **minimal** number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly **one** unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `"3322251"`:

Given a positive integer `n`, return the `n^th` term of the **count-and-say** sequence.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 30

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        
        # base case
        if n == 1:
            return "1"
        if n == 2:
            return "11"
        
        # starts from n == 2
        res = "11"
        
        # dynamic programming 
        # res always related to previous one
        # calculate n-2 times
        for i in range(2, n):
            # initial value for count-and-say
            pre = res[0]
            count = 1
            tmp = ""
            
            # go through each element starts from the second one
            for j in range(1, len(res)):
                # keep counting
                if res[j] == pre:
                    count += 1
                # update
                else:
                    tmp += str(count) + pre
                    pre = res[j]
                    count = 1
            # update the count-and-say
            tmp += str(count) + pre
            
            # update res
            res = tmp
            
        return res
```
