# 518. Coin Change II

## Problem

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

### Example 2

```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= coins.length <= 300
* 1 <= coins[i] <= 5000
* All the values of coins are unique.
* 0 <= amount <= 5000

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # res[i] stores the number of combinations when the amount is i
        res = [0]*(amount+1)
        
        # when amount is 0, the res is 1
        res[0] = 1
        
        for coin in coins:
            # For each coin in coins, if the coin is selected, then i-coin must exist, 
            # that is, dp[i] = sum(dp[i-coin])
            for i in range(coin, amount+1):
                res[i] += res[i-coin]
        
        return res[-1]
```
