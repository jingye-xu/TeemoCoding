# 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

## Problem

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list **sorted** as well.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/list2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
* The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        # base case
        if not head:
            return None
        
        # store the res points to head
        res = head
        
        while head and head.next:
            # if current head's val equals to head.next's val, skip head.next
            if head.val == head.next.val:
                head.next = head.next.next
            # update head to check the next
            else:
                head = head.next
        
        return res
```
