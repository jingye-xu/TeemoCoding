# 912. Sort an Array

## Problem

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4
* -5 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10^4

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def sortArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        # get length
        n = len(nums)

        if n > 1:
            mid = n // 2

            # recursively call
            left = self.sortArray(nums[:mid])
            right = self.sortArray(nums[mid:])
            
            # merge, initial index
            l,r,i = 0, 0, 0
            while l < len(left) and r < len(right):
                if left[l] <= right[r]:
                    nums[i] = left[l]
                    l += 1
                else:
                    nums[i] = right[r]
                    r += 1
                i += 1
            
            # check which index has not reached to the end
            while l < len(left):
                nums[i] = left[l]
                i += 1
                l += 1
            while r < len(right):
                nums[i] = right[r]
                i += 1
                r += 1
        
        return nums
```
