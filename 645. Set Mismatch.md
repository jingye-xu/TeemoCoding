# 645. Set Mismatch

## Problem

You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from `1` to `n`. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in `s` got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in **repetition of one** number and **loss of another** number.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,2]
```

## Constraints

* 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def findErrorNums(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        # get length
        n = len(nums)
        
        # sort the list
        nums = sorted(nums)
        
        # find the duplicated number
        for i in range(1, n):
            if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                # return the duplicated number and calculate the missing number
                # missing number = pretent sum - actual sum + duplicated number
                return [nums[i], (1+n)*n//2 - sum(nums) + nums[i]]
```
