# 213. House Robber II

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place **are arranged in a circle**. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 100
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # get length
        n = len(nums)
        
        # base case
        if n == 1:
            return nums[0]
        if n == 2:
            return max(nums)
        
        # since the houses are in circle, means the first and the last cannot be robbed at the same time
        # simplize it to a non-circle problem
        return max(self.robHelper(nums[0:n], n-1), self.robHelper(nums[1:n+1], n-1))
    
    # non-circle problem
    def robHelper(self, nums: List[int], length: int) -> int:
        
        # base case is checked in main function, no need here
        
        # initial values
        res = [nums[0], max(nums[0], nums[1])]
        
        for i in range(3, length+1):
            res.append(max(res[-1], res[-2] + nums[i-1]))
        
        return res[-1]
```
