# 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range

## Problem

Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` (inclusive).

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
```

## Constraints

* 0 <= low <= high <= 10^9

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        # move low to nearest odd
        low = low if low&1 else low+1
        # move high to nearest even
        high = high if not high&1 else high+1
        return (high-low+1)//2
```
