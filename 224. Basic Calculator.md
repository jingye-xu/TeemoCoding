# 224. Basic Calculator

## Problem

Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
```

### Example 3

```
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
* s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
* s represents a valid expression.
* '+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
* '-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
* There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
* Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        num, sign, stack = 0, 1, [0]

        for c in s:
            if c.isdigit():
                num = num*10 + int(c)
            elif c==' ':
                continue
            elif c == '+':
                stack[-1] += num * sign
                sign = 1
                num = 0
            elif c == '-':
                stack[-1] += num * sign
                sign = -1
                num = 0
            elif c == '(':
                stack.extend([sign,0])
                sign = 1
                num = 0
            elif c == ')':
                lastNum = (stack.pop() + num*sign) * stack.pop()
                stack[-1] += lastNum
                sign = 1
                num = 0
                
        return stack[-1]+num*sign
```
