# 72. Edit Distance

## Problem

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

  * Insert a character
  * Delete a character
  * Replace a character

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

### Example 2

```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

## Constraints

* 0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
* word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        
        # get length
        m = len(word1)
        n = len(word2)

        # dynamic programming
        # a (m+1)*(n+1) matrix store the number of operations when converting word1[:i] to word1[:j]
        d = [[None for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(m + 1)]

        # edges
        for i in range(m + 1):
            d[i][0] = i
        for j in range(n + 1):
            d[0][j] = j

        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                cost = 0 if word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1] else 1
                # d[i][j] can be got from 3 directions: up, left, up-left
                d[i][j] = min(
                    d[i - 1][j - 1] + cost,
                    d[i][j - 1] + 1,
                    d[i - 1][j] + 1)

        # return word1[:m] word2[:n]
        return d[m][n]
```
