# 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

## Problem

Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/17/linked.jpg)

```
Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in head is in the range [0, 2 * 10^4].
* -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not head:
            return None
        if not head.next:
            return TreeNode(head.val)
        
        # walker to find the mid node
        walker = head
        runner = head
        # left to for later use
        left = head
        # step records how many nodes in half
        step = 0

        while runner and runner.next:
            runner = runner.next.next
            walker = walker.next
            step += 1
        
        # go to the mid node's previous node
        for i in range(step-1):
            left = left.next
        
        # next node is None
        left.next = None

        # generate TreeNode
        root = TreeNode(walker.val)
        root.right = self.sortedListToBST(walker.next)
        root.left = self.sortedListToBST(head)

        return root
```
