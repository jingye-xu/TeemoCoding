# 443. String Compression

## Problem

Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:

* If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
* Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
```

### Example 2

```
Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= chars.length <= 2000
* chars[i] is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        
        # update function
        def update(insert:int, preChar: str, charCount: int, chars: List[str]) -> int:
            # insert char
            chars[insert] = preChar
            insert += 1
            
            # if count larger than 1
            if charCount > 1:
                for j in range(len(str(charCount))):
                    chars[insert] = str(charCount)[j]
                    insert += 1
            # update new insert index
            return insert
        
        insert = 0
        preChar = ""
        charCount = 0
        
        # go through the chars
        for i in range(len(chars)):
            # increment
            if chars[i] == preChar:
                charCount += 1
            # update
            else:
                # means preChar has value not ""
                if charCount:
                    insert = update(insert, preChar, charCount, chars)

                # update preChar and charCount
                preChar = chars[i]
                charCount = 1
        
        # update last segment
        insert = update(insert, preChar, charCount, chars)
        return insert
```
