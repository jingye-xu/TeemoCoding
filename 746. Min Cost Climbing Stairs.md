# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

## Problem

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.
```

## Constraints

* 2 <= cost.length <= 1000
* 0 <= cost[i] <= 999

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # if n stairs, need climb n+1 
        n = len(cost) + 1
        
        # res will finally be a list with a length of n
        # first two element no need cost, we can climb 2 steps to skip it
        res = [0, 0]
        
        # start from 2
        for i in range(2, n):
            
            # pick lowest
            res.append(min(cost[i-2] + res[i-2], cost[i-1] + res[i-1]))
                
        return res[len(cost)]
```
