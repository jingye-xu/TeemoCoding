# 701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree

## Problem

You are given the `root` node of a binary search tree (BST) and a `value` to insert into the tree. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is **guaranteed** that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

**Notice** that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return **any of them**.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: [4,2,7,1,3,5]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [40,20,60,10,30,50,70], val = 25
Output: [40,20,60,10,30,50,70,null,null,25]
```

### Example 3

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,null], val = 5
Output: [4,2,7,1,3,5]
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [0, 10^4].
* -10^8 <= Node.val <= 10^8
* All the values Node.val are unique.
* -10^8 <= val <= 10^8
* It's guaranteed that val does not exist in the original BST.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def insertIntoBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        
        # base case
        if not root:
            return TreeNode(val)
        
        # use head to go through and insert, use root to return
        head = root
        
        while True:
            # no need to compare if val exists, since it is guaranteed. 
            # but we can put it here to make the code comprehensive
            if head.val == val:
                print(f"{val} exists, no need to insert")
                break
            # when head.val < val, and right subtree is None, add val here
            elif head.val < val and not head.right:
                new = TreeNode(val)
                head.right = new
                break
            # when head.val > val, and left subtree is None, add val here
            elif head.val > val and not head.left:
                new = TreeNode(val)
                head.left = new
                break
            # else we need to update head
            else:
                head = head.left if head.val > val else head.right
                
        return root
```
