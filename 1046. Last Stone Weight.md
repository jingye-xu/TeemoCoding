# 1046. Last Stone Weight

## Problem

You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the `i^th` stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the **heaviest two stones** and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.
At the end of the game, there is **at most one** stone left.

Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return `0`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: stones = [1]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= stones.length <= 30
* 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # use python heap library to help us sort the list
        # please note that, Python's heap library implements a min-heap instead of a max-heap, whereby popping will give us the lightest stone instead of the heaviest stone. 
        
        # to address this, negative all values
        for i,s in enumerate(stones):
            stones[i] = -s
            
        # pass all values into the heap
        heapify(stones)
        
        while stones:
            # the heaviest stone
            s1 = -heappop(stones)  
            # s1 is the only element 
            if not stones:
                return s1
            
            s2 = -heappop(stones)
            
            # if s1 == s2, no need to push in, if s1>s2, push the difference value
            if s1 > s2:
                # always remember to push the negative value
                heappush(stones, s2-s1)
        
        # if all stones are destoried
        return 0
```
