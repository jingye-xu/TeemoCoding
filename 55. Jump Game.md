# 55. Jump Game

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        # get length
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 1:
            return True
        
        # i is the index, j is the maximum index can reach
        i, j = 0, nums[0]
        
        while i <= j and i < n:
            
            # update maximum index
            j = max(j, i+nums[i])
            
            # update
            i += 1
        
        return j >= n-1
```
