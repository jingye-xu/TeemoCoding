# 74. Search a 2D Matrix

## Problem

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value `target` in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`. This matrix has the following properties:

1. Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
2. The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat2.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
```

## Constraints

* m == matrix.length
* n == matrix[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 100
* -10^4 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10^4

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        
        # two important properties:
        # Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
        # The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
        
        # rows
        m = len(matrix)
        # cols
        n = len(matrix[0])
        
        # length of all
        len_all = m*n
        
        # two pointers 
        
        i = 0
        j = len_all - 1
        
        while i <= j:
            # mid number in all
            mid = (i+j)//2
            
            # index of mid
            (row, col) = self.obtain_index(m, n, mid)

            if matrix[row][col] == target:
                return True
            elif matrix[row][col] < target:
                i = mid + 1
            else:
                j = mid - 1
            
        return False
    
    def obtain_index(self, row: int, col: int, num_all: int) -> (int, int):
        return (num_all // col, num_all % col)
```
