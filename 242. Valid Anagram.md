# 242. Valid Anagram

## Problem

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
* s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        
        # anagram means they have the same length
        if len(t) != len(s):
            return False
        
        seen = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in s:
            seen[i] += 1
        
        for i in t:
            
            # not seen before
            if i not in seen:
                return False
            
            seen[i] -= 1
            
            # delete when seen[i] equals to 0
            if seen[i] == 0:
                del seen[i]
        
        return not seen
```
