# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

## Problem

Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees), every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2^h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/complete.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

### Example 3

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10^4
* The tree is guaranteed to be complete.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        return self.countNodes(root.left) + self.countNodes(root.right) + 1
```
