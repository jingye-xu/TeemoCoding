# 226. Invert Binary Tree

## Problem

Given the `root` of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/invert2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
```

### Example 3

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        
        # base case
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # please note: save old subtree is necessary, here I save both, you can only save one of them, but please remember if you only save one, recurcive call should start at the other one
        old_left = root.left
        old_right = root.right
        
        # recursive call
        root.left = self.invertTree(old_right)
        root.right = self.invertTree(old_left)
        
        return root
```
