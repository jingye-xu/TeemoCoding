# 221. Maximal Square

## Problem

Given an `m x n` binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, find the largest square containing only `1`'s and return its area.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/max2grid.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
Output: 1
```

### Example 3

```
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

* m == matrix.length
* n == matrix[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 300
* matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def maximalSquare(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        
        # get length
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        
        # pad 0 to the left and top
        # res is to store the maxsquare len when the max square has a bot-left at [i][j]
        res = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for i in range(m+1)]
        
        # store the maximun len of the square
        maxlen = 0
        
        for i in range(1, m+1):
            for j in range(1, n+1):
                # match the index at matrix and res
                # when the element is 1
                if matrix[i-1][j-1] == "1":
                    # we update res
                    res[i][j] = min(res[i-1][j], res[i][j-1], res[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                    maxlen = max(maxlen, res[i][j])
        
        return maxlen**2
```
