# 1832. Check if the Sentence Is Pangram

## Problem

A **pangram** is a sentence where every letter of the English alphabet appears at least once.

Given a string `sentence` containing only lowercase English letters, return `true` if `sentence` is a **pangram**, or `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: sentence = "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
Output: true
Explanation: sentence contains at least one of every letter of the English alphabet.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: sentence = "leetcode"
Output: false
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= sentence.length <= 1000
* sentence consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def checkIfPangram(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
        
        # Note: this function assumes the input string contains only lower letters
        
        # early exit
        if len(sentence) < 26:
            return False
        
        # store the seen letter
        seen = []
        
        # go throgh the sentence
        for i in sentence:
            # if not seen before, append
            if i not in seen:
                seen.append(i)
        
        # if the length equals to 26, means each letter we meet at least once
        return True if len(seen) == 26 else False
```
