# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

## Problem

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the `diameter` of the tree.  

The `diameter` of a binary tree is the `length` of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.  

The `length` of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.  

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
        # For a node, the length of longest path going through the node = height(left) + height(right)
        
        # initial value
        self.res = 0
        
        self.dfs(root)
        
        return self.res
    
    # use a seperate function to implement the DFS algorithm
    def dfs(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
        # base case
        if root is None:
            return 0
        
        # dfs
        h_left = self.dfs(root.left)
        h_right = self.dfs(root.right)
        
        self.res = max(self.res, h_left + h_right)
        
        # every recursive needs to plus 1, and the height depends on the highest branch
        return max(h_left, h_right) + 1
```
