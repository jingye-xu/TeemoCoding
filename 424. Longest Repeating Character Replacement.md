# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

## Problem

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
* s consists of only uppercase English letters.
* 0 <= k <= s.length

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        start = 0
        count = {}
        common = 0
        res = 0
        
        # starts from the index 0
        for end in range(len(s)):
            # update count and common value
            count[s[end]] = count.get(s[end], 0) + 1
            common = max(common, count[s[end]]) 
            
            # when the length exceeds the "common + k", it means, we need to increment start index to match the longest length
            # this works because the condition is true when we meet a new element which is not the common one
            # if we meet the common one, the common value will update to + 1, so the left expr and right expr will add 1 too.
            if end - start + 1 > common + k:
                count[s[start]] -= 1
                start += 1
            
            # update the longest length
            res = max(res, end - start + 1)
                
        return res
```
