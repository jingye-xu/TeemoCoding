# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

## Problem

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest **common subsequence**. If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

  * For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
* text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        
        # get length
        len1 = len(text1)
        len2 = len(text2)
        
        # a len1*len2 matrix that stores the result at [i,j]
        # res[i][j] stands the longest common subsequence for text1[:i] and text2[:j]
        res = [[0 for i in range(len2+1)] for i in range(len1+1)]
        
        for i in range(1, len1+1):
            for j in range(1, len2+1):
                if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                    res[i][j] = res[i-1][j-1] + 1
                else:
                    res[i][j]  = max(res[i-1][j], res[i][j-1])

        return res[-1][-1]
```
