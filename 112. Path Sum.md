# 112. Path Sum

## Problem

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsum1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsum2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
Output: false
Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
* -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
* -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:
        
        # base case
        if not root:
            return False
        
        # DFS algorithm
        # put root and root.val into the stacks
        stack_node = [root]
        stack_value = [root.val]
        
        # use set instead of list for a faster index
        seen = set()
        
        # when stack is not empty
        while stack_node:
            
            # read the last element
            last = stack_node[-1]
            # add to seen
            seen.add(last)
            
            # obtain left and right subtree variables
            l = last.left
            r = last.right
            
            # if has left and left is not in seen
            if l and l not in seen:
                stack_node.append(l)
                stack_value.append(l.val)
                seen.add(l)
            # if has right and right is not in seen
            elif r and r not in seen:
                stack_node.append(r)
                stack_value.append(r.val)
                seen.add(r)
            # if it is leaf node
            elif not l and not r:
                if sum(stack_value) == targetSum:
                    return True
                stack_node.pop(-1)
                stack_value.pop(-1)
            # otherwise, the current last node's all sub paths are checked
            # we can pop it out now
            else:
                stack_node.pop(-1)
                stack_value.pop(-1)
        
        return False
```
