# 1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal

## Problem

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A **string swap** is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return `true` if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing **at most one string swap** on **exactly one** of the strings. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
Output: true
Explanation: For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank". 
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
Output: true
Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
* s1.length == s2.length
* s1 and s2 consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        
        # special case
        if s1 == s2:
            return True
        
        res = []
        
        for i in range(len(s1)):
            # found 
            if s1[i] != s2[i]:
                res.append((s1[i], s2[i]))
            
            # early exit
            if len(res) > 2:
                return False
        
        if len(res) == 1:
            return False
        elif res[0][0] == res[1][1] and res[0][1] == res[1][0]:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
