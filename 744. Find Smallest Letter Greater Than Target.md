# 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

## Problem

Given a characters array letters that is sorted in **non-decreasing** order and a character target, return the smallest character in the array that is larger than target.

**Note** that the letters wrap around.

  * For example, if target == 'z' and letters == ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
```

### Example 2

```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
```

### Example 3

```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "d"
Output: "f"
```

## Constraints

* 2 <= letters.length <= 10^4
* letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.
* letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
* letters contains at least two different characters.
* target is a lowercase English letter.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        # get number
        tar = ord(target)
        
        if  tar >= ord(letters[-1]):
            return letters[0]
        
        left = 0
        right = len(letters) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            
            val = ord(letters[mid])
            
            if val > tar:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        
        return letters[left]
            
```
