# 63. Unique Paths II

## Problem

You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m-1][n-1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any square** that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10^9`.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot1.jpg)

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot2.jpg)

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

* m == obstacleGrid.length
* n == obstacleGrid[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 100
* obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        # base case
        # start place has obstacle
        if obstacleGrid[0][0]:
            return 0
        
        # get length
        m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        
        res = [[0 for i in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
        
        # robot is here
        res[0][0] = 1
        
        # dynamic programming
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                # only can reach to a place where has no obstacles
                if not obstacleGrid[i][j]:
                    # increment only the top and left exist
                    res[i][j] += res[i-1][j] if i >= 1 else 0
                    res[i][j] += res[i][j-1] if j >= 1 else 0
        
        return res[-1][-1]
```
