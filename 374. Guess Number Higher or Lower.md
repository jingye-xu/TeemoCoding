# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

## Problem

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

  * -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
  * 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
  * 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

### Example 3

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
* 1 <= pick <= n

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        
        # base case
        if n == 1:
             return 1
            
        left, right = 1, n
        
        # terminate when left == right
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if guess(mid) == 0:
                return mid
            elif guess(mid) > 0:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        # return left or right bc they are the same
        return right
```
