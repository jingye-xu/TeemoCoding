# 69. Sqrt(x)

## Problem

Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and only **the integer part** of the result is returned.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

### Example 2

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

## Constraints

* 0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        
        # base case
        if x <= 1:
            return x
        
        left = 0
        right = x
        
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            
            res = mid * mid
            if res == x:
                return mid
            elif res < x:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        
        # truncate
        return right-1
```
