# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem

Given a string `s`, find the length of the `longest substring` without repeating characters.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Constraints

* 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
* s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        # store seen
        seen = set()
        
        # max length
        max_len = 0
        
        # one pointer
        left = 0
        
        for right in range(len(s)):
            
            while s[right] in seen:
                # update left until s[right] not in seen
                seen.remove(s[left])
                left += 1
            
            # update max length
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
            
            # add new element in seen
            seen.add(s[right])
        
        return max_len
```
