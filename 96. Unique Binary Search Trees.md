# 96. Unique Binary Search Trees

## Problem

Given an integer `n`, return the number of structurally unique **BST**'s (binary search trees) which has exactly `n` nodes of unique values from `1` to `n`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 19

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        
        # res store answer at i, when there are i numbers
        res = [0] * (n+1)
        
        # initial values
        res[0] = res[1] = 1
        
        # first loop starts from 2 to n
        # cause we need to get the result when there are n numbers
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            
            # basic idea here is: when there are n numbers,
            # we have n conditions to consider because each of the number could be the root node
            # once determined the root node, the number of trees for that root node
            #    = (the number of unique trees on the left) times (the number of unique trees on the right)
            
            
            # loop i times, since there are i numbers
            for j in range(i):
                
                # increment res[i]
                # res[j] means the number of unique trees on the left: j number
                # res[i-j-1] means the number of unique trees on the right: i-j-1 number
                res[i] += res[j]*res[i-j-1]
        
        return res[n]
```
