# 994. Rotting Oranges

## Problem

You are given an `m x n` `grid` where each cell can have one of three values:

  * 0 representing an empty cell,
  * 1 representing a fresh orange, or
  * 2 representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return `-1`.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png)

```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
```

### Example 2

```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
```

## Constraints

* m == grid.length
* n == grid[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 10
* grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.
