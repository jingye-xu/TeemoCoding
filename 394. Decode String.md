# 394. Decode String

## Problem

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, `k`. For example, there will not be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.

The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed `10^5`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
```

### Example 3

```
Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 30
* s consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets '[]'.
* s is guaranteed to be a valid input.
* All the integers in s are in the range [1, 300].

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # this is a parsing problem
        # we can use stack to solve it
        
        # initialize values
        stack = []
        k = 0
        current_str = ""
        digits = "0123456789"
        
        # start parsing
        for i in s:
            # i is a number
            if i in digits:
                k = k*10 + int(i)
            
            # i is "[", means we can save current k and string
            elif i == "[":
                stack.append((current_str, k))
                # reset k and current_str
                k = 0
                current_str = ""
            # i is "]", means we can pop out the last append string and generate string
            elif i == "]":
                # the last element stores k for current string and the string before k
                last_str, last_k = stack.pop(-1)
                current_str = last_str + last_k * current_str
            else:
                current_str += i
        
        return current_str
```
