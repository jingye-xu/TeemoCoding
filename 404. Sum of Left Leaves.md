# 404. Sum of Left Leaves

## Problem

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

A **leaf** is a node with no children. A **left leaf** is a leaf that is the left child of another node.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/leftsum-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 24
Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
* -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sumOfLeftLeaves(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
        res = 0
        
        queue = [root]
        
        while queue:
            
            current = queue.pop(0)
            
            # the most important part
            # left branch, look ahead
            if current.left:
                # leaf
                if not current.left.left and not current.left.right:
                    res += current.left.val
                # not leaf
                else:
                    queue.append(current.left)
            # if has right branch, directly append
            if current.right:
                queue.append(current.right)
        
        return res
```
