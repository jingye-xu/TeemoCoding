# 876. Middle of the Linked List

## Problem

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the **second middle node**.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

## Constraint

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
* 1 <= Node.val <= 100

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        # two pointers
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        # loop when fast and fast.next is not None, so it can call next
        while fast and fast.next:
            # fast runs 2 steps
            fast = fast.next.next
            # slow walks 1 step
            slow = slow.next
        
        return slow
```
