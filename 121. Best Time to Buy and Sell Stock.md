# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Problem

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i^th` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing **a single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
* 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # initial value
        profit = 0
        
        # assume buy at day 1
        buyprice = prices[0]
        
        # start day 2
        i = 1
        while i < len(prices):
            
            # update buyprice when meeting a lower price
            if prices[i] < buyprice:
                buyprice = prices[i]
            # else, update the profit by calculating the diff between current price and buyprice
            else:
                profit = max(profit, prices[i] - buyprice)
            
            # dont forget to increase i
            i += 1
    
        return profit
```
