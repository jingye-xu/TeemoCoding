# 263. Ugly Number

## Problem

An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` is an **ugly number**.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
```

## Constraints

* -2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:
        
        if n == 1:
            return True
        
        factor = [2, 3, 5]
        
        old_n = None
        
        while n != old_n :
            
            old_n = n
            
            if n in factor:
                return True
            
            for i in factor:
                if n%i == 0:
                    n /= i
                    break
```
