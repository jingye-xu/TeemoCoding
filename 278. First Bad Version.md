# 278. First Bad Version

## Problem

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1

## Solutions

### Python3

```
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        
        # bad must exist
        # binary search
        
        # left pivot
        l = 1
        
        # if the most left is bad
        if isBadVersion(1):
            return 1
        
        # r pivot must be bad
        r = n

        # binary search
        while l<r:
            # middle pivot
            m = l + (r - l) // 2
            if m == l:
                break
            if isBadVersion(m):
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        # after the loop done, l points to the right most good, and r points to the left most bad
        return r
```
