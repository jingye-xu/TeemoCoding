# 389. Find the Difference

## Problem

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

## Constraints

* 0 <= s.length <= 1000
* t.length == s.length + 1
* s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        
        res = 0
        
        # use XOR to solve the problem
        # ord: transfer char to ASCII
        # chr: transfer ASCII to char
        for i in s:
            res ^= ord(i)
        for i in t:
            res ^= ord(i)
        
        return chr(res)
```
