# 1162. As Far from Land as Possible

## Problem

Given an n x n grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.
```

## constraints

* n == grid.length
* n == grid[i].length
* 1 <= n <= 100
* grid[i][j] is 0 or 1

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        lands = []
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        res = 0

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j]:
                    lands.append([i, j])
        # base case
        if len(lands) == m*n or not lands:
            return -1
        
        # bfs
        while lands:
            res += 1
            # pick current level lands
            for i in range(len(lands)):
                x, y = lands.pop(0)
                directions = [[x+1, y], [x-1, y], [x, y+1], [x, y-1]]
                # four directions
                for new_x, new_y in directions:
                    # validation check
                    if 0 <= new_x < len(grid) and 0 <= new_y < len(grid[0]):
                        # can paint to 1
                        if grid[new_x][new_y] == 0:
                            # paint to 1
                            grid[new_x][new_y] = 1
                            # add to queue
                            lands.append([new_x, new_y])
        
        return res-1
