# 279. Perfect Squares

## Problem

Given an integer `n`, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= n <= 10^4

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        
        # base case
        if n < 2:
            return n
        
        # initial values
        res = []
        i = 1
        
        # when i^2 < n
        # store the candidates to transfer this problem into a sum problem
        while i * i <= n:
            res.append( i * i )
            i += 1
        
        # initial count to 0
        count = 0
        
        toCheck = {n}
        
        # check dict
        while toCheck:
            count += 1
            temp = set()
            for x in toCheck:
                for y in res:
                    if x == y:
                        return count
                    if x < y:
                        break
                    temp.add(x-y)
            toCheck = temp

        return count
```
