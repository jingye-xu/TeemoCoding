# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` `(1 <= k < nums.length)` such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not in `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

### Example 3

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
* -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
* All values of nums are unique.
* nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
* -10^4 <= target <= 10^4

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        
        # base case
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 0 if nums[0] == target else -1
        
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            
            # three conditions that target may be in left branch
            # condition 1: left branch is sorted and target is between nums[0] and nums[mid]
            # condition 2: left branch is rotated and target is less than both
            # condition 3: left branch is rotated and target is larger than both
            if nums[0] <= target < nums[mid] or target < nums[mid] < nums[0] or nums[mid] < nums[0] <= target:
                right = mid - 1
            
            else:
                left = mid + 1

        return -1
```
