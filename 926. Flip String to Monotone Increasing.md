# 926. Flip String to Monotone Increasing

## Problem

A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of 0's (possibly none), followed by some number of 1's (also possibly none).

You are given a binary string s. You can flip s[i] changing it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of flips to make s monotone increasing.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "00110"
Output: 1
Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "010110"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: s = "00011000"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 00000000.
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
* s[i] is either '0' or '1'

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def minFlipsMonoIncr(self, s: str) -> int:
        # consider the result string as two windows
        # Initially, 
        # the left window is empty and the right window contains the whole string. 
        # At each step, the left window's size increases by one 
        # and the right window's size decreases by 1
        
        # Let left1 be the number of '1's in the current left window and right0 be the number of '0's in the current right window. When the left window increases and the right window shrinks by 1 character, it means we move a character c from right to left:

        # If c = '0', left1 will be unchanged and right0 will be decreased by 1, so the sum of them will be decreased by 1.

        # If c = '1', left1 will be increased by 1 and right0 will be unchanged so the sum of them will be increased by 1.

        # m = left1 + right0
        m = 0
        # separator at idx 0
        # calculate m = right0
        for c in s:
            if c == '0':
                m += 1
        res = m
        # move separator from idx=0 to idx=len-1
        for c in s:
            if c == '0':
                m -= 1
                res = min(res, m)
            else:
                m += 1
        return res
```
