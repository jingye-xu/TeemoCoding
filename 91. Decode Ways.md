# 91. Decode Ways

## Problem

A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

```
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
```

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106"` can be mapped into:

  * "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
  * "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06"` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6"` is different from `"06"`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the **number** of ways to **decode** it.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

### Example 3

```
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 100
* s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
        # get length
        n = len(s)
        
        # base case
        if s[0] == "0":
            return 0
        
        # initial value is 1 before the first char in s
        # res stores the 
        res = [0] * (n + 1)
        res[0] = res[1] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            
            # special case, early stop
            if s[i] == "0" and int(s[i-1]) > 2:
                return 0
            
            # when the element at i is not 0, 
            # increment by res[i]
            if s[i] != "0":
                res[i+1] += res[i]
            
            # when the element at i-1 to i can be from 1 to 26
            # increment by res[i-1]
            # be careful that s[i-1] should not be 0
            if s[i-1] != "0" and 1 <= int(s[i-1:i+1]) <= 26:
                res[i+1] += res[i-1]
            
        return res[n]
```
