# 383. Ransom Note

## Problem

Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` if `ransomNote` can be constructed by using the letters from `magazine` and `false` otherwise.

Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false
```

### Example 2

```
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false
```

### Example 3

```
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= ransomNote.length, magazine.length <= 10^5
* ransomNote and magazine consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        
        # count these two strings
        count_ransom = collections.Counter(ransomNote)
        count_magazine = collections.Counter(magazine)
        
        # go through the keys in count_ransom
        for k in count_ransom.keys():
            # check if magazine has enough number of that k
            # if not, return false
            if count_ransom[k] > count_magazine[k]:
                return False
            
        return True
```
