# 376. Wiggle Subsequence

## Problem

A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

  * For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a **wiggle sequence** because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` alternate between positive and negative.
  * In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

A **subsequence** is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest **wiggle subsequence** of `nums`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).
```

### Example 3

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

## Solutions

### Python3

```
class Solution:
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # get length
        n = len(nums)
        
        # base case
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        
        # sign
        sign = nums[1] - nums[0]
        
        # initial value
        res = 1 if sign == 0 else 2
        
        # greedy, find the point that wiggle, max min peak
        for i in range(2, n):
            newsign = nums[i] - nums[i-1]
            if (newsign > 0 and sign <= 0) or (newsign < 0 and sign >= 0):
                res += 1
                sign = newsign
                
        return res
```
