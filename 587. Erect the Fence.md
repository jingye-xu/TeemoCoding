# 587. Erect the Fence

## Problem

You are given an array `trees` where `trees[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of a tree in the garden.

You are asked to fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope as it is expensive. The garden is well fenced only if **all the trees are enclosed**.

Return the coordinates of trees that are exactly located on the fence perimeter.

## Examples

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/erect2-plane.jpg)

```
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,0],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2]]
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/erect1-plane.jpg)

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]
Output: [[4,2],[2,2],[1,2]]
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= points.length <= 3000
* points[i].length == 2
* 0 <= xi, yi <= 100
* All the given points are unique.
